Settings
========

.. _ref-settings-OCCURRENCE_CANCEL_REDIRECT:

OCCURRENCE_CANCEL_REDIRECT
--------------------------

This setting controls the behavior of ``Views.get_next_url``. If set, all calendar modifications will redirect here (unless there is a `next` set in the request.)

.. _ref-settings-show-cancelled-occurrences:

SHOW_CANCELLED_OCCURRENCES
--------------------------

This setting controls the behavior of ``Period.classify_occurrence``. If True, then occurrences that have been cancelled will be displayed with a css class of canceled, otherwise they won't appear at all.

Defaults to False

.. _ref-settings-check-event-perm-func:

CHECK_EVENT_PERM_FUNC
---------------------

This setting controls the callable used to determine if a user has permission to edit an event or occurrence. The callable must take the object (event) and the user and return a boolean.

example::

    check_edit_permission(ob, user):
        return user.is_authenticated

If ob is None, then the function is checking for permission to add new events.

.. _ref-settings-check-calendar-perm-func:

CHECK_CALENDAR_PERM_FUNC
------------------------

This setting controls the callable used to determine if a user has permission to add, update or delete events in a specific calendar. The callable must take the object (calendar) and the user and return a boolean.

example::

    check_edit_permission(ob, user):
        return user.is_authenticated


.. _ref-settings-get-events-func:

GET_EVENTS_FUNC
---------------

This setting controls the callable that gets all events for calendar display. The callable must take the request and the calendar and return a `QuerySet` of events. Modifying this setting allows you to pull events from multiple calendars or to filter events based on permissions.

example::

    get_events(request, calendar):
        return calendar.event_set.all()

EVENT_END_DEFAULT_DURATION
--------------------------

An event can be created without an end date.
In this case the field default_end is set to True and this setting is used to supply an end date some time way into the future.

The value should be a dictionary of keywords for dateutil.relativedelta

example:
    {"years": 99}
